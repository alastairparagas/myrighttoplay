Between 4 and 7 June 1942, \r\napproximately one month after the Battle of the Coral Sea and six months after Japan''s attack on \r\nPearl Harbor, the United States Navy decisively defeated an Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) attack \r\nagainst Midway Atoll, inflicting irreparable damage on the Japanese.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese operation, like the earlier attack on Pearl Harbor, aimed to eliminate the United \r\nStates as a strategic power in the Pacific, thereby giving Japan a free hand in establishing its \r\nGreater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. It was hoped another demoralizing defeat would force \r\nthe U.S. to negotiate an end to the Pacific War on conditions favorable to Japan.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese plan was to lure the United States'' few remaining aircraft carriers into a trap. The \r\nJapanese also intended to occupy Midway Atoll as part of an overall plan to extend their defensive \r\nperimeter in response to the Doolittle Raid. This operation was considered preparatory for further \r\nattacks against Fiji and Samoa.\r\n\r\nThe plan was handicapped by faulty Japanese assumptions of American reaction and poor initial \r\ndispositions. Most significantly, American codebreakers were able to determine the date and \r\nlocation of the attack, enabling the forewarned U.S. Navy to set up an ambush of its own. Four \r\nJapanese aircraft carriers and a heavy cruiser were sunk in exchange for one American aircraft \r\ncarrier and a destroyer.
